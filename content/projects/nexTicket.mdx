NextTicket is a ticketing solution developed during my project phase at the Greenfox Academy. Built on a robust technology stack, it incorporates Node.js, Express.js, Next.js (React.js), and MySQL, among other advanced tools. Key features include seamless user authentication using JWT Tokens, and a comprehensive RESTful API tailored for developers. Notably, the platform is adeptly deployed on Railway with an integrated CI/CD pipeline, ensuring smooth updates and high reliability. I am particularly proud of our team's achievements and my significant contributions to this sophisticated project.
